# Crowdfunding-ETL

This was a good challenge as this seems very apllicable to what we may see in a real world data analyst role. I really enjoy performing anaylsis using SQL.

## Summary

This analysis will provide Independent Funding a quick and easy way to review which campaigns are still short of thier funding goals. This single analysis will save
 the campaign managers time as they will not have to review several different CSV files to find this information. In today's world TIME IS MONEY and any amount of time
 that can be saved means saving money.
